My favorite painting in all the world is in Valletta, Malta, at the St John's Co Cathedral. Valetta is a maze of a city on an island of mazes and caves. It is a pile-- neolithic ruins converted into Roman temples converted into cathedrals, the scratches of the older empires still evident on their facade. The stone there is old, and glows in such a fantastic way-- I tried to paint it but never captured how it works.

It is evident in Caravaggio's painting-- the light is exactly right, but through a hole in the roof, like all the rest of his paintings.

St John, a small man, is bleeding todeath-- you can almost see him shivering from the blood loss, his skin turning gray. Above him, a brute of a man, very large, holds the machete he is about to use to cut his head off. To
