It's important to note this painting is attributed to Caravaggio.

I think it's one of his paintings because it is bad. Like, not a mediocre work of a genius (i.e., all of Rubens work that isn't at the Prado), but an actively bad painting that would (and should) have been thrown away had it not been painted by Caravaggio.

It is ugly, awkward and grotesque with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and I think it's the key to Caravaggio's work. You see, I think it represents all of Caravaggio's weaknesses so well. Caravaggio painted the way he painted because he could not do otherwise. His entire practice was based on finding success built on his limited resources.

As I like to put it: you must chew through the world with your own teeth. They might be as rotten as the tooth getting pulled, but you still only have that.

As I fail at what I do I keep this in mind-- I can only think and write and make art in the way that I can, and I fully understand how bad at all this I actually am. But that doesn't stop me from chewing, even with these rotten teeth.
